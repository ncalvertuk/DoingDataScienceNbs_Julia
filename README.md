#  Introduction
This repo is a collection of notebooks that I have created from the exercises in the [Doing Data Science : Straight Talk from the Frontline book][booklink] by Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt published by O'Reilly Media. The notebooks are written using the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). Currently there are notebooks for exercises in Chapters 2 & 3. 

I have created a binder from the notebooks, which can be found here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ncalvertuk/DoingDataScienceNbs_Julia/master)
Click on the notebook you want to run (in Binder) and it should open. Ensure you change the Kernel to Julia before executing any cells.
