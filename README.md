#  Introduction
This repo is a collection of notebooks that I have created from the exercises in the [Doing Data Science : Straight Talk from the Frontline book][booklink] by Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt published by O'Reilly Media. The notebooks are written using the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). Currently there are notebooks for exercises in Chapters 2 & 3.
