The most severe damage is situated southbound roughly halfway between the Didcot road junction and the Fulscot railway bridge. Damage consists of a stretch of approximately 3 meters long by 0.5 meter wide and more importantly up to 0.3 meters deep. Because this damage has been primarily caused by heavy vehicles a heavy camber exists pushing cyclists and other traffic off the roads and into the verge. PLEASE NOTE THIS IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE CLASSED AS A PRIORITY JOB</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>Potholes</td><td>The enclosed potholes have damaged my alloy wheels due to recent poor works occurred on this stretch of route. My low profile alloys have been damaged hard. I had my daughter on board to witness the incident . I have informed Thames Valley police because of safety concerns especially for motor cyclists if they hits these potholes. They have authorised for the highway agencies to be informed immediately to avoid any accidents or potential death especially to motor cyclists and have advised to alert yourselves. I have obtained a reference number from the police and I will be contacting my insurance company regards to the damage caused to my alloy wheels which I intend to have repaired. My main concern is safety. I would like someone in your department to contact me please.</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>Flytipping</td><td>White vans with waste are being turned away from the council tip and refused to offload their rubbish. This is due to the council imposing a free to obtain license for vans. These vans then flytip alongside other irresponsible flytippers in this recycle area. This needs to be actioned and the names of those flytipping published weekly in the newspaper. This flytipping is unchallenged. More needs to be done as council taxes are being wasted on this problem created due to a license imposed on vans by the council. The council refuses vans to dump but has to then pay for removal of resulting flytipping. This is a crazy misuse of resources.</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>Parks &amp; Green Spaces</td><td>Hi, I have just visited &amp;quot;Penparcau Playing Field&amp;quot; and it is in a VERY BAD state of repair. I thought that I would report it as it appears to be heavily used and is in a residential area. You might already know this but, - The wooden park gate does not shut, so children could run out, near a busy road - The dog bag dispenser is rusty, sharp and dangerous. - The tarmac path is not level near the entrance to the play area, pot hole. - There is graffiti on the play equipment. - Some of the play equipment is in poor condition and the plywood is splintering away. - There is a fallen tree in the area. - I noticed that the fence around the play area needs repairing. - The play area sign is damaged, bent and sharp. - Seats are rotten and need repairing and painting - There appears to be a pool of water in the children&amp;#39;s play area!? Under a piece of rusting disused play equipment. As you walk in from the under pass it is all on the right hand side of the park. It is such a shame to see this in this condition in touch a prominent area. Hope it sorted soon :) Please pass on to the right people county council or a community council. Thanks</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>We have an ongoing issue with neigbours who have two cars parking infront of other neighbours drives. Does the double yellow lines not get inforced on weekends ? People parking on double yellow lines during weekends and evenings. We have neighbours from hell and they are continuely parking infront of our drive even when asked not to on several occasions. We face abuse if we say anything. There is also a double yellow line infront of the drive. I have a photo but dont want to be victimised. As i have been in the past. Seems like the council is doing less and less inforcement checks at weekends with neighbours even parking on pavements. There needs to be strict fines. Also no proper checks to see how many people are living in these houses. Alot of littering and dumping haringey council is doing nothing ? Weekend infircement checjs is required please to stop abusers and on the spot fine please is what i would like to see. Our area is becoming run down.</td></tr><tr><th>6</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>I live in a cul-de-sac with my house being towards the end. A few houses have drives and those with drives infront of the house park their car on them. The problem is others park their car or car(s) in such a way that it blocks my access into and out of my driveway and causes problems to get out of the street. There have been a number of occasions that I have had to go knocking on doors to find out whose car it is and politely ask them to move it. Aside from it being an inconvenience and also a problem for anyone turning the car around, I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be responsible for scratching anyone&amp;#39;s car either. This has been going on for some time now (12 months or more).</td></tr><tr><th>7</th><td>Flytipping</td><td>Photo a bit small, but shows a bed frame and a shopping trolley in undergrowth beside canal. At junction of Foxglove Path and Longmarsh Lane by small footbridge. Generally, litter picking along this stretch on both sides of canal is almost non existent (see pic) and a lot of plastic ends up actually in the canal....blown or thrown there. I pick it up myself at least twice a week. Again, as always in West Thamesmead, there are hardly any bins...just an old oil drum (see pic) which is rusting at the bottom so the foxes can drag out what rubbish people DO decide to dispose of. Perhaps also Tesco in Thamesmead (one of the dirtiest stores I&amp;#39;ve ever been in) could be encouraged to get involved in the clean up as most of the rubbish along the canal is their packaging. Or the Thamesmead Fishing Club. But BINS BINS BINS in West Thamesmead please..lots of them...LOADS on streets leading from Woolwich Arsenal, but as soon as you&amp;#39;re into West Thamesmead....nothing. And the ones that are there hardly ever get emptied.</td></tr><tr><th>8</th><td>Potholes</td><td>The footpath outside my house and several others in close proximity has lots of potholes that are dangerous to local users. the dropped curves are worse with large holes appearing. several elderly people live in this area and have difficulty getting past in their scooters. the majority of Camp Hill Road has had all its paths and access points tarmacked and repaired over the last year , but for some unknown reason this end of the road was omitted. Could this be given priority before the winter sets in and makes the matter worse.</td></tr><tr><th>9</th><td>Flytipping</td><td>Yet more fly-tipping on the walkway between the railway bridge and Brintons Road. The bags of rubbish by the railway bridge have not been cleared even after months of reporting them! Recently there were items of chipboard dumped at the end of Wolverton Road, a sofa on the pavement and other assorted items dumped behind the wall at the seating area. Litter everywhere you look in this area between the two roads. When is someone going to clean it up? Or, better still, will those responsible stop dumping the stuff? Photos are available but for some reason they were not upload-able on this site today.</td></tr><tr><th>10</th><td>Parks &amp; Green Spaces</td><td>This bin doesn&amp;#39;t have a metal liner and people put bags of waste including food scraps, vegetable peelings, food containers etc in it every week. The local dogs/ foxes/ gulls rip the side of the bin and pull the waste through onto the grass and path, and then it is distributed about the park. Not sanitary, safe for dogs to eat as they walk by or pleasant to look at. Please can the council put a metal liner in the bin and this will resolve the issue of the food waste being pulled out all over the park at least.</td></tr><tr><th>11</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>Some residents have decided to park their cars on Cupar Road opposite the housing scheme rather than within designated off-street parking areas within Springbank. This is blocking one lane of the main road and causes dangerous queing of traffic as the cars are parked right next to a zebra crossing and waiting cars restrict other drivers vision of people waiting to cross the zebra crossing. This is a busy area for School Children crossing. Last night there was a serious collision where a car travelling on the main road collided with one of the parked cars causing serious damage. There need to be double yellow lines painted along this stretch of road as car parking here is dangerous and the parked cars are causing serious problems.</td></tr><tr><th>12</th><td>Pavements/footpaths</td><td>The temporary fencing around the site of the former Mountain Ash pub is damaged yet again and is blocking the footpath, the owners of this site obviously don&amp;#39;t care about public safety or the state of the site, parts of the fencing have been broken and missing for about 18 months allowing children to enter the dangerous site, the whole site needs new more permanent fencing putting up or even better clear and landscape the whole site, this site is an eyesore and it&amp;#39;s about time the council stepped in and forced the site owners to clear the site or at least make it secure so people can&amp;#39;t just walk straight on to it.</td></tr><tr><th>13</th><td>Pavements/footpaths</td><td>If I were to go out, sweep up the leaves, that are 12 inches deep or more in a few places, and then wantonly put them into refuse bags ready for collection would I be arrested, prosecuted and executed for leaving illegal garden waste on the pavement or is it best to just hope that they all rot away before anyone slips on them? They have already been swept into piles to make it easier, if that helps, or is that a punishable offence too. Please don&amp;#39;t respond by putting stickers on the piles of leaves.</td></tr><tr><th>14</th><td>Flytipping</td><td>Council removed large bin with a weeks notice, have not told residents when collection day is, no information on the website and therefore residents are abandoning their rubbish at the bottom on the stairs, which is the access to the the flats from 2A end. Council not very helpful in the situation and extremely rude on the phone. Would just like some assistance in the matter to resolve this issue, maybe recycling bins to be delivered to all house holds to reduce the amount of waste and also a place designated to put bins out on collection day only. Also informing the residents of when collections are would be a great start.</td></tr><tr><th>15</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>Our street ( Firs Lane) is used as alternative route. This is happening for 2 moths already. The problem is that all the cars are either speeding like crazy or they get stuck on stupid queues. There is no parking spaces for residents and if you find one you find your car bashed. We can&amp;#39;t rest during the day or night because of loud noises coming form cars stuck in traffic or from drivers arguing and swearing. It is unacceptable. Please find a way to prevent this as it is stressing us out. This is unfair. I pay all my taxes and also a huge rent for the place that I leave in.</td></tr><tr><th>16</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>The cars are parked inconsiderately on the path which causes pedestrians to walk in the road or on the grass , secondly its cause issues when trying to access drives of the houses opposite where they have parked, this happens most days and you get two or three cars , last week there where even cars parked directly on the bend . the car parking issue is more of an issue when trying to reverse or park on to the drives . Finally there has been a couple of near miss accidents as cars coming in to Kempton Grove are forced on the wrong side of the road , if cars are leaving this means that they meet face to face on the bend when one car is on the wrong side of the road this can be a real problem</td></tr><tr><th>17</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>I live in the flats and i can&amp;#39;t get my car out as people are parking on the double yellow lines and when i asked someone to move to let me out i got no help. I have a baby who has breathing difficulties and if i had to call an ambulance there is a high chance it wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get down the street to my flat. People park on double yellow lines and on the pavement and almost daily i&amp;#39;m forced to walk in the road with my pram. Council tax isn&amp;#39;t cheap and the situation with the parking on double yellow lines is distressing me greatly. People park there to go to the shops and the surgery ignoring the yellow lines. we need a traffic warden urgently or at least a security camera. My father picked myself and my son up to take us to a doctors appointment for my baby and he couldn&amp;#39;t get out for over ten minutes because people were queing to turn their cars around and parking on the double yellow lines making it impossible to exit our car park. Please help as this situation is horrendous. I have lived here for two years and nothing has been done.</td></tr><tr><th>18</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>Over the last year there has been a huge increase of parked cars on Manthorp road. A lot of the surrounding roads require resident permits &amp;amp; I believe people use the road to park so they can then walk down to Woolwich Arsenal mainline or DLR stations. Even of an evening it is too congested. As the road is a bend, often cars drive up or down fast &amp;amp; due to the high volume of parked cars, they quickly meet traffic &amp;amp; there are no vacant spaces for cars to pull in to pass each other meaning everyone has to reverse. Due to this, a reversing van ended up crushing in the front end of my wife&amp;#39;s car. Also, there are more than 1 cars &amp;quot;For Sale&amp;quot; left on the road including a Silver Honda Accord &amp;amp; an orange Toyota IS200. More frustrating is a resident owns 2 large white Mercedes Sprinter Vans &amp;amp; takes up valuable space on the road.</td></tr><tr><th>19</th><td>Potholes</td><td>This pothole is in the middle of the access road for Temple Cowley Health Centre and the residents of Temple House (the OCC flats above the practice). It has been there for some time and is now very large and causes difficulty for residents who are parking at the back of the building. Because of its size it is a health and safety hazard as a frail or elderly pedestrian could easily injure themselves if they didn&amp;#39;t avoid it. Oxford Health also run a baby and toddler clinic from Temple Cowley Health Centre so there is a lot of pushchair and toddler traffic. It will continue to get larger because of the proximity of the drain as the tarmac will be further eroded.</td></tr><tr><th>20</th><td>Flytipping</td><td>As well as the continuous reports of litter being thrown from cars up old hill and awaiting a road closure that has been promised now for 6 months, I was walking up old hill this morning and now we have bags of rubbish dumped opposite old hill farm on the entry/exit of high elms.....how much longer do we have to put up with the debris, litter, cans, rubbish in general, our road is disqusting and a total embarrassment...there are residents trying to sell their property at present, this will not help them, I certainly would not buy a house where u constantly have to go and pick litter up from your own driveway following the morning or afternoon rush hour....</td></tr><tr><th>21</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>Every weekday, especially between the hours of 7.30-8.30am a succession of vans completely obstruct the pavement while loading or unloading. Despite myself and other members of the public registering our concerns and pointing out the obvious danger to the public, the drivers continue this practice regardless of the very real threat to the public. We have witnessed several occasions where there have been very close misses and we feel it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed or seriously injured here. We also feel it is the councils responsibility to act now before a serious accident occurs, we have seen some (limited) parking regulation in the area but it is ineffective and does not appear to operate at all during the early morning periods when this problem is most dangerous</td></tr><tr><th>22</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>A Blue Ford Transit van is parking outside residents houses for the past 2 months, leaving residents knowhere to park in the street. The Blue Van has the number plate 0V60 WFZ. The van owner uses his other car ( Citroen Berlingo) plate LA56 ZCZ to drive off. He parks up the van outside number 92-98 block of Kingsdale road and then leaves the van and drives off in the citroen. It is unfair that a van can be left outside residents homes whilst we have to struggle to find someone to park. This has been ongoing for 2 months now, and I am sick of seeing this van here. I do not know why the van has left outside the residents home.</td></tr><tr><th>23</th><td>Car Parking</td><td>There are always vehicles parked on the path at the end of Backmoor Crescent, often not leaving enough room to walk past, nevermind a pram or wheelchair (there are both young children and elderly on the road). The only alternative is to walk around the vehicles on the road which is dangerous as they are also parked too close to the junction, two offences. The same issue walking up Matthews Lane by the new houses, which can be dangerous as there are more prams trying to get to school at the same time</td></tr><tr><th>24</th><td>Potholes</td><td>Yet again there are large pot holes in the road directly opposite 65 The Paddocks. These pot holes appear every few months or so due to the large buses that use the road. The repairs as seen in the photo are simply not suitable and the small section of road needs re-laying. Damage is being caused to parked cars caused by flying stones and should there be serious damage needing repair, claims will be made against the relevant authority for reimbursement. Please attend and fix urgently as the holes get worse day by day. Please also list this as needing a full road repair as this happens at least 4-6 times a year.</td></tr><tr><th>25</th><td>Potholes</td><td>This road is FULL of very large potholes due to the increased usage of this route to Soho Farmhouse. The road is narrow as it is and when two cars are passing it is impossible to avoid a pothole without coming to a complete standstill. I drive a Mini and this is doing a lot of damage to my wheels, tyres and wheel alignment/balance. I know I speak for all the residents along this route when I say I would be extremely grateful if this road could be addressed especially now in the Winter months when surface water and ice will do even more damage.</td></tr><tr><th>26</th><td>Pavements/footpaths</td><td>We are at the Stables opposite Hartshill Hayes Country Park. I have noticed new signs about access for cycles into Hartshill Hayes however there is no access for Horses. With the current rise in accidents to horses, riders and car drivers it would make sense to allow access to horses too. It would be much safer to ride in the country park than on the narrow, twisty lanes in the surrounding areas. http://www.bhs.org.uk/ safety-and-accidents/ dead-slow?gclid=CjwKEAiAm8nCBRD7xLj-2aWFyz8SJAAQNala1QopvsJamaVqqD9WgdJPkWpfwZNMFylYhaTLyglethoCVwTw_wcB While we have access to St Laurence&amp;#39;s Wood, why would it not make sense to allow access to the the Hayes. I am a dog owner and regularly walk in the woods, it would make no difference if horses came through on certain paths, as there is enough space for everyone to enjoy it. Surely if cycles are now allowed horses should be too. These spaces are few and far between it would be nice if we could all enjoy them together. It would be quite an attraction for children to see horses and riders in the woods, I am not talking about galloping around, this is just a different route to maybe allow a bit more variety in a safe traffic free environment. It is allowed in other parks across the area.</td></tr><tr><th>27</th><td>Potholes</td><td>This road is a disgrace and very dangerous to cars and especially to cyclists. The road humps are not noticeable, especially in poor lighting, because the road markings are faded. There is damage all over the road with many breaks and holes. Cars and bikes swerve all over the road to avoid holes. Also, the road humps are very tall, irregular and uneven which damages the underneath of cars. The whole thing needs resurfacing urgently before a cyclist is knocked off or goes into a hole and falls off. This has been a problem for a long time and needs to be properly dealt with as a matter of urgency.</td></tr><tr><th>28</th><td>Pavements/footpaths</td><td>Wolseley Road bridge/Barne Road junction is an accident black spot that has already been complained about and has been dangerous for a considerable amount of time. . Considering that it&amp;#39;s the route most children have to walk to get to school there is no crossing or consideration for pedestrians to cross. The footpath on the northwestern side of the bridge is not fit for purpose and buses and other large vehicles quite often mount the kerb. I&amp;#39;ve seen numerous accidents and dangerous occurrences, the latest being this morning, a child hit by a car. It is currently made far worse by the roadworks. This needs immediate attention.</td></tr><tr><th>29</th><td>Pavements/footpaths</td><td>Road and kerbside is covered in leaves and mud in places which are now wet and slippy. Particularly treacherous as much of the pavement is damaged and uneven, and this is hidden under a mat of wet leaves and litter, creating potentially dangerous walking and driving conditions.This is a walk to school route, the pedestrian route to Ravelrig Riding for the Disabled, and is also used by elderly residents to access the bus service or shops. I use it to walk to the bus stop to get to work, and I would be really grateful if you could make my walking route a bit safer, the speeding cars are bad enough without being worried about slipping too.</td></tr><tr><th>30</th><td>Potholes</td><td>Pothole reported last year. Nothing done about it in our area. At entrance to parking area, on path/road right where children have to walk as well for school. Causes cars to have to try avoid or could pop tyres! Easily a tripping area! Opposite our entrance area on other side they&amp;#39;ve had thier potholes done this year! Why not this one! Its gotten bigger obviously &amp;amp; with colder weather will increase &amp;amp; crack further! So again shall report as nothing was done with it! Plenty of council trucks been on estate!</td></tr><tr><th>&vellip;</th><td>&vellip;</td><td>&vellip;</td></tr></tbody></table>"

The bags of rubbish by the railway bridge have not been cleared even after months of reporting them! Recently there were items of chipboard dumped at the end of Wolverton Road, a sofa on the pavement and other assorted items dumped behind the wall at the seating area. Litter everywhere you look in this area between the two roads. When is someone going to clean it up? Or, better still, will those responsible stop dumping the stuff?

The local dogs/ foxes/ gulls rip the side of the bin and pull the waste through onto the grass and path, and then it is distributed about the park. Not sanitary, safe for dogs to eat as they walk by or pleasant to look at. Please can the council put a metal liner in the bin and this will resolve the issue of the food waste being pulled out all over the park at least. \\\\\n",
       "\t11 & Car Parking & Some residents have decided to park their cars on Cupar Road opposite the housing scheme rather than within designated off-street parking areas within Springbank. This is blocking one lane of the main road and causes dangerous queing of traffic as the cars are parked right next to a zebra crossing and waiting cars restrict other drivers vision of people waiting to cross the zebra crossing. This is a busy area for School Children crossing. Last night there was a serious collision where a car travelling on the main road collided with one of the parked cars causing serious damage. There need to be double yellow lines painted along this stretch of road as car parking here is dangerous and the parked cars are causing serious problems. \\\\\n",

Finally there has been a couple of near miss accidents as cars coming in to Kempton Grove are forced on the wrong side of the road , if cars are leaving this means that they meet face to face on the bend when one car is on the wrong side of the road this can be a real problem \\\\\n",

People park on double yellow lines and on the pavement and almost daily i\\&\\#39;m forced to walk in the road with my pram. Council tax isn\\&\\#39;t cheap and the situation with the parking on double yellow lines is distressing me greatly. People park there to go to the shops and the surgery ignoring the yellow lines. we need a traffic warden urgently or at least a security camera. My father picked myself and my son up to take us to a doctors appointment for my baby and he couldn\\&\\#39;t get out for over ten minutes because people were queing to turn their cars around and parking on the double yellow lines making it impossible to exit our car park. Please help as this situation is horrendous. I have lived here for two years and nothing has been done. \\\\\n",
       "\t18 & Car Parking & Over the last year there has been a huge increase of parked cars on Manthorp road. A lot of the surrounding roads require resident permits \\&amp; I believe people use the road to park so they can then walk down to Woolwich Arsenal mainline or DLR stations. Even of an evening it is too congested. As the road is a bend, often cars drive up or down fast \\&amp; due to the high volume of parked cars, they quickly meet traffic \\&amp; there are no vacant spaces for cars to pull in to pass each other meaning everyone has to reverse. Due to this, a reversing van ended up crushing in the front end of my wife\\&\\#39;s car. Also, there are more than 1 cars \\&quot;For Sale\\&quot; left on the road including a Silver Honda Accord \\&amp; an orange Toyota IS200. More frustrating is a resident owns 2 large white Mercedes Sprinter Vans \\&amp; takes up valuable space on the road. \\\\\n",
       "\t19 & Potholes & This pothole is in the middle of the access road for Temple Cowley Health Centre and the residents of Temple House (the OCC flats above the practice). It has been there for some time and is now very large and causes difficulty for residents who are parking at the back of the building. Because of its size it is a health and safety hazard as a frail or elderly pedestrian could easily injure themselves if they didn\\&\\#39;t avoid it. Oxford Health also run a baby and toddler clinic from Temple Cowley Health Centre so there is a lot of pushchair and toddler traffic. It will continue to get larger because of the proximity of the drain as the tarmac will be further eroded. \\\\\n",
       "\t20 & Flytipping & As well as the continuous reports of litter being thrown from cars up old hill and awaiting a road closure that has been promised now for 6 months, I was walking up old hill this morning and now we have bags of rubbish dumped opposite old hill farm on the entry/exit of high elms.....how much longer do we have to put up with the debris, litter, cans, rubbish in general, our road is disqusting and a total embarrassment...there are residents trying to sell their property at present, this will not help them, I certainly would not buy a house where u constantly have to go and pick litter up from your own driveway following the morning or afternoon rush hour.... \\\\\n",
       "\t21 & Car Parking & Every weekday, especially between the hours of 7.30-8.30am a succession of vans completely obstruct the pavement while loading or unloading. Despite myself and other members of the public registering our concerns and pointing out the obvious danger to the public, the drivers continue this practice regardless of the very real threat to the public. We have witnessed several occasions where there have been very close misses and we feel it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed or seriously injured here. We also feel it is the councils responsibility to act now before a serious accident occurs, we have seen some (limited) parking regulation in the area but it is ineffective and does not appear to operate at all during the early morning periods when this problem is most dangerous \\\\\n",
       "\t22 & Car Parking & A Blue Ford Transit van is parking outside residents houses for the past 2 months, leaving residents knowhere to park in the street. The Blue Van has the number plate 0V60 WFZ. The van owner uses his other car ( Citroen Berlingo) plate LA56 ZCZ to drive off. He parks up the van outside number 92-98 block of Kingsdale road and then leaves the van and drives off in the citroen. It is unfair that a van can be left outside residents homes whilst we have to struggle to find someone to park. This has been ongoing for 2 months now, and I am sick of seeing this van here. I do not know why the van has left outside the residents home. \\\\\n",
       "\t23 & Car Parking & There are always vehicles parked on the path at the end of Backmoor Crescent, often not leaving enough room to walk past, nevermind a pram or wheelchair (there are both young children and elderly on the road). The only alternative is to walk around the vehicles on the road which is dangerous as they are also parked too close to the junction, two offences. The same issue walking up Matthews Lane by the new houses, which can be dangerous as there are more prams trying to get to school at the same time \\\\\n",
       "\t24 & Potholes & Yet again there are large pot holes in the road directly opposite 65 The Paddocks. These pot holes appear every few months or so due to the large buses that use the road. The repairs as seen in the photo are simply not suitable and the small section of road needs re-laying. Damage is being caused to parked cars caused by flying stones and should there be serious damage needing repair, claims will be made against the relevant authority for reimbursement. Please attend and fix urgently as the holes get worse day by day. Please also list this as needing a full road repair as this happens at least 4-6 times a year. \\\\\n",
       "\t25 & Potholes & This road is FULL of very large potholes due to the increased usage of this route to Soho Farmhouse. The road is narrow as it is and when two cars are passing it is impossible to avoid a pothole without coming to a complete standstill. I drive a Mini and this is doing a lot of damage to my wheels, tyres and wheel alignment/balance. I know I speak for all the residents along this route when I say I would be extremely grateful if this road could be addressed especially now in the Winter months when surface water and ice will do even more damage. \\\\\n",
       "\t26 & Pavements/footpaths & We are at the Stables opposite Hartshill Hayes Country Park. I have noticed new signs about access for cycles into Hartshill Hayes however there is no access for Horses. With the current rise in accidents to horses, riders and car drivers it would make sense to allow access to horses too. It would be much safer to ride in the country park than on the narrow, twisty lanes in the surrounding areas. http://www.bhs.org.uk/ safety-and-accidents/ dead-slow?gclid=CjwKEAiAm8nCBRD7xLj-2aWFyz8SJAAQNala1QopvsJamaVqqD9WgdJPkWpfwZNMFylYhaTLyglethoCVwTw\\_wcB While we have access to St Laurence\\&\\#39;s Wood, why would it not make sense to allow access to the the Hayes. I am a dog owner and regularly walk in the woods, it would make no difference if horses came through on certain paths, as there is enough space for everyone to enjoy it. Surely if cycles are now allowed horses should be too. These spaces are few and far between it would be nice if we could all enjoy them together. It would be quite an attraction for children to see horses and riders in the woods, I am not talking about galloping around, this is just a different route to maybe allow a bit more variety in a safe traffic free environment. It is allowed in other parks across the area. \\\\\n",
       "\t27 & Potholes & This road is a disgrace and very dangerous to cars and especially to cyclists. The road humps are not noticeable, especially in poor lighting, because the road markings are faded. There is damage all over the road with many breaks and holes. Cars and bikes swerve all over the road to avoid holes. Also, the road humps are very tall, irregular and uneven which damages the underneath of cars. The whole thing needs resurfacing urgently before a cyclist is knocked off or goes into a hole and falls off. This has been a problem for a long time and needs to be properly dealt with as a matter of urgency. \\\\\n",
       "\t28 & Pavements/footpaths & Wolseley Road bridge/Barne Road junction is an accident black spot that has already been complained about and has been dangerous for a considerable amount of time. . Considering that it\\&\\#39;s the route most children have to walk to get to school there is no crossing or consideration for pedestrians to cross. The footpath on the northwestern side of the bridge is not fit for purpose and buses and other large vehicles quite often mount the kerb. I\\&\\#39;ve seen numerous accidents and dangerous occurrences, the latest being this morning, a child hit by a car. It is currently made far worse by the roadworks. This needs immediate attention. \\\\\n",
       "\t29 & Pavements/footpaths & Road and kerbside is covered in leaves and mud in places which are now wet and slippy. Particularly treacherous as much of the pavement is damaged and uneven, and this is hidden under a mat of wet leaves and litter, creating potentially dangerous walking and driving conditions.This is a walk to school route, the pedestrian route to Ravelrig Riding for the Disabled, and is also used by elderly residents to access the bus service or shops. I use it to walk to the bus stop to get to work, and I would be really grateful if you could make my walking route a bit safer, the speeding cars are bad enough without being worried about slipping too. \\\\\n",

Damage is being caused to parked cars caused by flying stones and should there be serious damage needing repair, claims will be made against the relevant authority for reimbursement. Please attend and fix urgently as the holes get worse day by day.

I am a dog owner and regularly walk in the woods, it would make no difference if horses came through on certain paths, as there is enough space for everyone to enjoy it. Surely if cycles are now allowed horses should be too. These spaces are few and far between it would be nice if we could all enjoy them together. It would be quite an attraction for children to see horses and riders in the woods, I am not talking about galloping around, this is just a different route to maybe allow a bit more variety in a safe traffic free environment.
